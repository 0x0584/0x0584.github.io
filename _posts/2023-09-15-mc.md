# Maximum Clique and NP-Complete

The maximum clique is an old problem in Computer Science. It is proven that it is indeed [NP-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness). Thus, at best we can find optimised solutions rather than solving it optimally.

# Algorithm

Before we start, and after reading the graph, we first enumerate the vertices as keys, and sort them based on the their [colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) of each vertex.

After that, while there are vertices and there still branches we read the neighbours of each vertex and start a thread branching over the neighbours where for each thread we pick the highest-coloured vertex, most promising to be part of a max clique, and look for all vertices that are adjacent to it in all other neighbours (recursively).

When reaching an empty set of vertices, we backtrack and collect vertices if a maximum clique has been already in that thread, we shall find it if the size of the maximum clique overall has changed during the processing.

# Source code

Recently, I have [merged](https://www.github.com/UnickSoft/GraphOffline/pull/9) a PR into a graph visualisation library called [graphonline](https://www.graphonline.top). It was based on this [draft](https://www.github.com/0x0584/mc).
