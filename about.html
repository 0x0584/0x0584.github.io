    <h1>about 0x0584</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm 0x0584, 24 years old, and I'm a passionate programmer. I've been programming for a while now; mainly for fun. I got my bachelor's degree as a database administrator in 2018.</p>

    <p>The nickname 0x0584 comes from the Japanese anime Kaido Kid, with its nickname 1412, which means KID eventually. And he was one of my favorite childhood anime characters, so I've picked the name after doing some clever or thought so, programming tricks.</p>
